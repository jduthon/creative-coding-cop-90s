# Creative Coding COP: BACK TO THE 90S INTERWEB BABY!

For this Creative Coding COP, we decided to go with a simple but powerful theme: design and build your best 90's inspired internet website!

That's right, no React (well, you can use it if you want of course), no fancy schmancy parallax, just good ol' crappy GIFs and pixelated designs!

We prepare this little starter kit for you, it's a barebone HTML5 file with a CSS and JavaScript files to go together with it.
Opening the HTML file, you should see a blue Hello World! on the page and a "Hello World!" message in your browser console. (Tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari)

Here is a little complition with website inspirations for you: [https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/web-design-in-the-90s#google_vignette](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/web-design-in-the-90s#google_vignette)

For some nice 90s like GIFs straight from GeoCities, feel free to use [this amazing gif search from the Internet Archive](https://gifcities.org/) ⭐️


So grab your time machine, put on your best Britney Spears' playlist and go make the most beautiful 90s website! (Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course)
